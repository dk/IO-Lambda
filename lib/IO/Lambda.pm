=head1 NAME

IO::Lambda - non-blocking I/O in lambda style

=head1 SYNOPSIS

The code below executes parallel HTTP requests

   use strict;
   use IO::Lambda qw(:lambda);
   use IO::Socket::INET;

   # create a lambda object
   sub http
   {
      my ( $host, $url) = @_;

      my $socket = IO::Socket::INET-> new( 
         PeerAddr => $host, 
         PeerPort => 80 
      );

      lambda {
         context $socket;
      write {
         print $socket "GET $url HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n";
         my $buf = '';
      read {
         return $buf unless 
            sysread( $socket, $buf, 1024, length($buf));
         again;
      }}}
   }

   # fire up a single lambda and wait until it completes
   print http( 'www.perl.com', '/')-> wait;

   # fire up a lambda that waits for two http requests in parallel
   lambda {
      context
         http( 'www.perl.com', '/'),
         http( 'www.google.com', '/');
      tails {
         print @_;
      }
   }-> wait;

Note: C<io> and C<lambda> are synonyms - I personally prefer C<lambda> but some
find the word slightly inappropriate, hence C<io>.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is another attempt to fight the horrors of non-blocking I/O
programming. It tries to bring back the simplicity of the declarative
programming style, that is only otherwise available when one employs threads,
coroutines, or co-processes.  Usually coding non-blocking I/O for single
process, single thread programs requires construction of state machines, often
fairly complex, which doesn't help the clarity of the code. Not unlike monads
in functional languages, that enforce order of execution over generally
orderless functions, this framework helps programmer to express the order of
execution of I/O callbacks in a coding style that resembles sequential,
declarative programming.

The manual begins with code examples, then explains basic assumptions, then
finally gets of the complex concepts, where the real fun begins. You may skip
directly there (L<Stream IO>), where functional style mixes with I/O. 

=head2 Apologetics

There are many async libraries readily available from CPAN. C<IO::Lambda> is
yet another one. How is it different from the existing tools? Why using it?  To
answer these questions, I need to show the evolution of async libraries, to
show how they grew from simple tools to more complex frameworks.

First, all async libraries are based on OS-level syscalls, like C<select>,
C<poll>, C<epoll>, C<kqueue>, and C<Win32::WaitForMultipleObjects>. The first
layer of async libraries provides access to exactly these facilites: there are
C<IO::Select>, C<IO::Epoll>, C<IO::Kqueue> etc. I won't go deepeer into
describing pros and contras for programming on this level, this should be more
or less obvious.

Perl modules of the next abstraction layer are often characterised by
portability and event loops. While the modules of the first layer are seldom
portable, and have no event loops, the second layer modules strive to be
OS-independent, and use callbacks to ease the async IO programming. These
modules mostly populate the "asynchronous input-output programming frameworks"
niche in the perl world. The examples are many: C<IO::Events>, C<EV>,
C<AnyEvent>, C<IO::NonBlocking>, to name the few. 

Finally, there's the third layer of complexity, which, before C<IO::Lambda>,
had a single representative: C<POE> (now, to the best of my knowledge,
C<IO::Async> also falls in this category). Modules of the third layer are based
on concepts from the second, but introduce a tool to help with the programming
of complex protocols, something that isn't available in the second layer
modules: finite state machines. The FSMs machines reduce complexity when
programming, for example, intricate network protocols, that are best modelled
as a set of states. Modules from the second layer do not provide much help
here.  Also, the third layer modules are agnostic of the event loop module: the
programmer is (almost) free to choose the event loop backend, such as C<Gtk>,
C<Prima>, or C<AnyEvent>, depending on the nature of the task.

C<IO::Lambda> also allows the programmer to build complex protocols, and is
also based on event loops, callbacks, and is portable. It differs from C<POE>
in the way the FSMs are declared. Where C<POE> requires an explicit switch from
one state to another, using f.ex. C<post> or C<yield> commands, C<IO::Lambda>
incorporates the switching directly into the program syntax. Consider C<POE>
code:

   POE::Session-> create(
       inline_states => {
           state1 => sub { 
	      print "state1\n";
	      $_[ KERNEL]-> yield("state2");
	   },
	   state2 => sub {
	      print "state2\n";
	   },
   });

and correspodning C<IO::Lambda> code:

    lambda {
       state1 {
	  print "state1\n";
       state2 {
	  print "state2\n";
       }}
    }

Here, the programming style is (deliberately) not much different from the declarative

    print "state1\n";
    print "state2\n";

as much as the nature of asynchronous programming allows that.

To sum up, the intended use of C<IO::Lambda> is for areas where simple
callback-based libraries require much additional work, and where state machines
are beneficial. Complex protocols like HTTP, parallel execution of several
tasks, strict control of task and protocol hierarchy - this is the domain where
C<IO::Lambda> works best.

=head2 Reading lines from a filehandle

Given C<$filehandle> is non-blocking, the following code creates a lambda
object (later, simply a I<lambda>) that reads from the handle until EOF or an
error occured. Here, C<getline> (see L<Stream IO> below) constructs a lambda
that reads a single line from a filehandle.

    use IO::Lambda qw(:all);

    sub my_reader
    {
       my $filehandle = shift;
       lambda {
           context getline, $filehandle, \(my $buf = '');
       tail {
           my ( $string, $error) = @_;
           if ( $error) {
               warn "error: $error\n";
           } else {
               print $string;
               return again;
           }
       }}
    }

Assume we have two socket connections, and sockets are non-blocking - read from
both of them in parallel. The following code creates a lambda that reads from
two readers:

    sub my_reader_all
    {
        my @filehandles = @_;
	lambda {
	    context map { my_reader($_) } @filehandles;
	    tails { print "all is finished\n" };
	}
    }

    my_reader_all( $socket1, $socket2)-> wait;

=head2 Non-blocking HTTP client

Given a socket, create a lambda that implements the HTTP protocol

    use IO::Lambda qw(:all);
    use IO::Socket;
    use HTTP::Request;

    sub talk
    {
        my $req    = shift;
        my $socket = IO::Socket::INET-> new( PeerAddr => 'www.perl.com', PeerPort => 80);

	lambda {
	    context $socket;
	    write {
	        # connected
		print $socket "GET ", $req-> uri, "\r\n\r\n";
		my $buf = '';
		read {
		    sysread $socket, $buf, 1024, length($buf) or return $buf;
		    again; # wait for reading and re-do the block
		}
	    }
	}
    }

Connect and talk to the remote

    $request = HTTP::Request-> new( GET => 'http://www.perl.com');

    my $q = talk( $request );
    print $q-> wait; # will print content of $buf

Connect two parallel connections: by explicitly waiting for each 

    $q = lambda {
        context talk($request);
	tail { print shift };
        context talk($request2);
	tail { print shift };
    };
    $q-> wait;

Connect two parallel connections: by waiting for all

    $q = lambda {
        context talk($request1), talk($request2);
	tails { print for @_ };
    };
    $q-> wait;

Teach our simple http request to redirect by wrapping talk().
talk_redirect() will have exactly the same properties as talk() does

    sub talk_redirect
    {
        my $req = shift;
	lambda {
	    context talk( $req);
	    tail {
	        my $res = HTTP::Response-> parse( shift );
		return $res unless $res-> code == 302;

		$req-> uri( $res-> uri);
	        context talk( $req);
		again;
	    }
	}
    }

=head2 Working example

    use strict;
    use IO::Lambda qw(:lambda);
    use IO::Socket::INET;

    sub get
    {
        my ( $socket, $url) = @_;
        lambda {
            context $socket;
        write {
            print $socket "GET $url HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n";
            my $buf = '';
        read {
            my $n = sysread( $socket, $buf, 1024, length($buf));
            return "read error:$!" unless defined $n;
            return $buf unless $n;
            again;
        }}}
    }

    sub get_parallel
    {
        my @hosts = @_;

	lambda {
	   context map { get(
              IO::Socket::INET-> new(
                  PeerAddr => $_, 
                  PeerPort => 80 
              ), '/index.html') } @hosts;
	   tails {
	      join("\n\n\n", @_ )
	   }
	}
    }

    print get_parallel('www.perl.com', 'www.google.com')-> wait;

=head1 API

=head2 Events and states

A lambda is an C<IO::Lambda> object, that waits for IO and timeout events, and
for events generated when other lambdas are completed. On each such event a
callback is executed. The result of the execution is saved, and passed on to the
next callback, when the next event arrives.

Life cycle of a lambda goes through three modes: passive, waiting, and stopped.
A lambda that is just created, or was later reset with C<reset> call, is in
passive state.  When the lambda is started, the only callback associated with the
lambda will be executed:

    $q = lambda { print "hello world!\n" };
    # not printed anything yet
    $q-> wait; # <- here will

Lambdas are usually not started explicitly; the function that waits for a
lambda, also starts it. C<wait>, the synchronous waiter, and C<tail>/C<tails>,
the asynchronous ones, start passive lambdas when called. Lambda is I<finished>
when there are no more events to listen to. The example lambda above will
finish right after C<print> statement.

Lambda can listen to events by calling I<predicates>, that internally subscribe
the lambda object to corresponding file handles, timers, and other lambdas.
There are only those three types of events that basically constitute everything
needed for building a state machine driven by external events, in particular,
by non-blocking I/O. Parameters passed to predicates with explicit C<context>
call, not by perl subroutine call convention. In the example below,
lambda watches for file handle readability:

    $q = lambda {
        context \*SOCKET;
	read { print "I'm readable!\n"; }
	# here is nothing printed yet
    };
    # and here is nothing printed yet

Such lambda, when started, will switch to the waiting state, - will be waiting
for the socket. The lambda will finish only after the callback associated with
C<read> predicate is called.

Of course, new events can be created inside all callbacks, on each state. This
style resembles a dynamic programming of sorts, when the state machine is not
hard-coded in advance, but is built as soon as code that gets there is executed.

The events can be created either by explicitly calling predicates, or by
restarting the last predicate with C<again> call. For example, code

     read { int(rand 2) ? print 1 : again }

will print indeterminable number of ones.

=head2 Contexts

Each lambda callback (further on, merely lambda) executes in its own, private
context. The context here means that all predicates register callbacks on an
implicitly given lambda object, and keep the passed parameters on the context
stack. The fact that context is preserved between states, helps building terser
code with series of IO calls:

    context \*SOCKET;
    write {
    read {
    }}

is actually a shorter form for

    context \*SOCKET;
    write {
    context \*SOCKET; # <-- context here is retained from one frame up
    read {
    }}

And as the context is kept, the current lambda object is also, in C<this>
property. The code above is actually

    my $self = this;
    context \*SOCKET;
    write {
    this $self;      # <-- object reference is retained here
    context \*SOCKET;
    read {
    }}

C<this> can be used if more than one lambda needs to be accessed. In which case,

    this $object;
    context @context;

is the same as

    this $object, @context;

which means that explicitly setting C<this> will always clear the context.

=head2 Data and execution flow

A lambda is initially called with arguments passed from outside. These
arguments can be stored using the C<call> method; C<wait> and C<tail> also
issue C<call> internally, thus replacing any previous data stored by C<call>.
Inside the lambda these arguments are available as C<@_>.

Whatever is returned by a predicate callback (including C<lambda> predicate),
will be passed as C<@_> to the next callback, or to the outside, if the lambda
is finished. The result of a finished lambda is available by C<peek> method,
that returns either all array of data available in the array context, or first
item in the array otherwise. C<wait> returns the same data as C<peek> does.

When more than one lambda watches for another lambda, the latter will get its
last callback results passed to all the watchers. However, when a lambda
creates more than one state that derive from the current state, a forking
behaviour of sorts, the latest stored results will get overwritten by the first
executed callback, so constructions like

    read  { 1 + shift };
    write { 2 + shift };
    ...
    wait(0)

will eventually return 3, but whether it will be 1+2 or 2+1, is not known.

C<wait> is not the only function that synchronises input and output data.
C<wait_for_all> method waits for all lambdas, including the caller, to finish.
It returns collected results of all the objects in a single list.
C<wait_for_any> method waits for at least one lambda, from the list of passed
lambdas (again, including the caller), to finish. It returns list of finished
objects as soon as possible.

=head2 Time

Timers and I/O timeouts can be given not only in the timeout values, as it
usually is in event libraries, but also as deadlines in (fractional) seconds
since epoch. This decision, strange at first sight, actually helps a lot when
a total execution time is to be tracked. For example, the following code reads as
many bytes as possible from a socket within 5 seconds:

   lambda {
       my $buf = '';
       context $socket, time + 5;
       read {
           if ( shift ) {
	       return again if sysread $socket, $buf, 1024, length($buf);
	   } else {
	       print "oops! a timeout\n";
	   }
	   $buf;
       }
   };

Rewriting the same code with C<read> semantics that accepts time as a timeout
instead, would be not that elegant:

   lambda {
       my $buf = '';
       my $time_left = 5;
       my $now = time;
       context $socket, $time_left;
       read {
           if ( shift ) {
	       if (sysread $socket, $buf, 1024, length($buf)) {
	           $time_left -= (time - $now);
		   $now = time;
		   context $socket, $time_left;
	           return again;
	       }
	   } else {
	       print "oops! a timeout\n";
	   }
	   $buf;
       }
   };

However, the exact opposite is true for C<sleep>. The following two lines
both sleep 5 seconds:

   lambda { context 5;        sleep {} }
   lambda { context time + 5; sleep {} }

Internally, timers use C<Time::HiRes::time> that gives the fractional number of
seconds. This however is not required for the caller, because when high-res
timers are not used, timeouts will simply be less precise, and will jitter
plus-minus half a second.

=head2 Predicates

All predicates receive their parameters from the context stack, or simply the
I<context>. The only parameter passed to them by using perl call, is the callback
itself.  Predicates can also be called without a callback, in which case, they
will pass further data that otherwise would be passed as C<@_> to the
callback. Thus, a predicate can be called either as

    read { .. code ... }

or 

    &read(); # no callback

Predicates can either be used after explicit exporting

   use IO::Lambda qw(:lambda);
   lambda { ... }

or by using the package syntax,

   use IO::Lambda;
   IO::Lambda::lambda { ... };

=over

=item lambda()

Creates a new C<IO::Lambda> object.

=item io()

Same as C<lambda>.

=item read($filehandle, $deadline = undef)

Executes either when C<$filehandle> becomes readable, or after C<$deadline>.
Passes one argument, which is either TRUE if the handle is readable, or FALSE
if time is expired. If C<deadline> is C<undef>, then no timeout is registered,
that means that it will never be called with FALSE.

=item write($filehandle, $deadline = undef)

Exactly same as C<read>, but executes when C<$filehandle> becomes writable.

=item readwrite($flags, $filehandle, $deadline = undef)

Executes either when C<$filehandle> satisfies any of the condition C<$flags>,
or after C<$deadline>. C<$flags> is a combination of three integer constants,
C<IO_READ>, C<IO_WRITE>, and C<IO_EXCEPTION>, that are imported with

   use IO::Lambda qw(:constants);

Passes one argument, which is either a combination of the same C<IO_XXX> flags,
that report which conditions the handle satisfied, or 0 if time is expired. If
C<deadline> is C<undef>, no timeout is registered, i.e. will never return 0.

=item sleep($deadline)

Executes after C<$deadline>. C<$deadline> cannot be C<undef>.

=item tail($lambda, @parameters)

Issues C<< $lambda-> call(@parameters) >>, then waits for the C<$lambda>
to complete. Since C<call> can only be done on inactive lambdas, will
fail if C<@parameters> is not empty and C<$lambda> is already running.

By default, C<tail> resets lambda if is was alredy finished. This
behavior can be changed by manipulating C<autorestart> property.

=item tails(@lambdas)

Executes when all objects in C<@lambdas> are finished, returns the collected,
unordered results of the objects.

=item tailo(@lambdas)

Same as C<tails>, but the results are ordered.

=item any_tail($deadline,@lambdas)

Executes either when all objects in C<@lambdas> are finished, or C<$deadline>
expires. Returns lambdas that were successfully executed during the allotted
time.

=item again(@frame = ())

Restarts the current state with the current context. All the predicates above,
excluding C<lambda>, are restartable with C<again> call (see C<start> for
restarting a C<lambda>). The code

   context $obj1;
   tail {
       return if $null++;
       context $obj2;
       again;
   };

is thus equivalent to

   context $obj1;
   tail {
       context $obj2;
       &tail();
   };

C<again> passes the current context to the predicate.

If C<@frame> is provided, then it is treated as result of previous C<restartable> call.
It contains data sufficient to restarting another call, instead of the current.
See C<restartable> for details.

=item context @ctx

If called with no parameters, returns the current context, otherwise
replaces the current context with C<@ctx>. It is thus not possible 
(not that it is practical anyway) to clear the context with this call.
If really needed, use C<this(this)> syntax.

=item this $this, @ctx

If called with no parameters, returns the current lambda.
Otherwise, replaces both the current lambda and the current context.
Can be useful either when juggling with several lambdas, or as a
convenience over C<my> variables, for example,

    this lambda { ... };
    this-> wait;

instead of

    my $q = lambda { ... };
    $q-> wait;

=item restartable(@frame)

If called without parameters, returns the current callback frame, that
can be later used in C<again>. Otherwise, replaces the internal frame
variables, that doesn't affect anything immediately, but will be used by C<again>
that is called without parameters.

This property is only used when the predicate inside which C<restartable> was
fetched, is restartable. Since it is not a requirement for a user-defined
predicate to be restartable, this property is not universally useful.

Example:

    context lambda { 1 };
    tail {
        return if 3 == shift;
    	my @frame = restartable;
        context lambda { 2 };
	tail {
	   context lambda { 3 };
	   again( @frame);
	}
    }

The outermost tail callback will be called twice: first time in the normal course of events,
and second time as a result of the C<again> call. C<restartable> and C<again> thus provide
a kind of restartable continuations.

=item predicate $lambda, $callback, $method, $name

Helper function for creating predicates, either from lambdas 
or from lambda constructors.

Example: convert existing C<getline> constructor into a predicate:

   sub gl(&) { getline-> call(context)-> predicate( shift, \&gl, 'gl') }
   ...
   context $fh, $buf, $deadline;
   gl { ... }

=back

=head2 Stream IO

The whole point of this module is to help building complex protocols in a
clear, consequent programming style. Consider how perl's low-level C<sysread>
and C<syswrite> relate to its higher-level C<readline>, where the latter not
only does the buffering, but also recognizes C<$/> as input record separator.
The section above described lower-level lambda I/O predicates, that are only
useful for C<sysread> and C<syswrite>; this section tells about higher-level
lambdas that relate to these low-level ones, as the aforementioned C<readline>
relates to C<sysread>.

All functions in this section return the lambda, that does the actual work.
Not unlike as a class constructor returns a newly created class instance, these
functions return newly created lambdas. Such functions will be further referred
as lambda constructors, or simply I<constructors>. Therefore, constructors are
documented here as having two inputs and one output, as for example a function
C<sysreader> is a function that takes 0 parameters, always returns a new
lambda, and this lambda, in turn, takes four parameters and returns two. This
constructor will be described as

    # sysreader() :: ($fh,$buf,$length,$deadline) -> ($result,$error)

Since all stream I/O lambdas return same set of scalars, the return type
will be further on referred as C<ioresult>:

    # ioresult    :: ($result, $error)
    # sysreader() :: ($fh,$buf,$length,$deadline) -> ioresult

C<ioresult>'s first scalar is defined on success, and is not otherwise.  In the
latter case, the second scalar contains the error, usually either C<$!> or
C<'timeout'> (if C<$deadline> was set).

Before describing the actual functions, consider the code that uses them.
Let's take a lambda that needs to implement a very simple HTTP/0.9 request:

   lambda {
       my $handle = shift;
       my $buf = '';
       context getline, $handle, $buf;
   tail {
       my $req = shift;
       die "bad request" unless $req =~ m[GET (.*)$]i;
       do_request($handle, $1);
   }}

C<getline> will read from C<$handle> to C<$buf>, and will wake up when new line
is there. However, what if we need, for example, HTTPS instead of HTTP, where
reading from socket may involve some writing, and of course some waiting?
Then the first default parameter to getline has to be replaced. By default, 

   context getline, $handle, $buf;

is the same as 

   my $reader = sysreader;	  
   context getline($reader), $handle, $buf;

where C<sysreader> creates a lambda C<$reader>, that given C<$handle>, waits
when it becomes readable, and reads from it. C<getline>, in turn, repeatedly
calls C<$reader>, until the whole line is read.

Thus, we call 

   context getline(https_reader), $handle, $buf;

instead, that should conform to sysreader signature:

   sub https_reader
   {
       lambda {
           my ( $fh, $buf, $length, $deadline) = @_;
	   # read from SSL socket
	   return $error ? (undef, $error) : $data;
       }
   }

I don't show the actual implementation of a HTTPS read (if you're curious, look
at L<IO::Lambda::HTTP::HTTPS> ), but the idea is that inside that reader, it is
perfectly fine to do any number of read and write operations, and wait for
their completion, as long as the lambda will sooner or later returns the data.
C<getline> (or, rather, C<readbuf> that C<getline> is based on) won't care
about internal states of the reader. 

Note: check out F<t/06_stream.t> that emulates reading and writing in this
fashion.

=over

=item sysreader() :: ($fh, $buf, $length, $deadline) -> ioresult

Creates a lambda that accepts all the parameters used by C<sysread> (except
C<$offset> though), plus C<$deadline>. The lambda tries to read C<$length>
bytes from C<$fh> into C<$buf>, when C<$fh> becomes available for reading. If
C<$deadline> expires, fails with C<'timeout'> error. On successful read,
returns number of bytes read, or C<$!> otherwise.

=item syswriter() :: ($fh, $buf, $length, $offset, $deadline) -> ioresult

Creates a lambda that accepts all the parameters used by C<syswrite> plus
C<$deadline>. The lambda tries to write C<$length> bytes to C<$fh> from C<$buf>
from C<$offset>, when C<$fh> becomes available for writing. If C<$deadline>
expires, fails with C<'timeout'> error. On successful write, returns number of
bytes written, or C<$!> otherwise.

=item readbuf($reader = sysreader()) :: ($fh, $buf, $cond, $deadline) -> ioresult

Creates a lambda that is able to perform buffered reads from C<$fh>, either
using custom lambda C<reader>, or using one newly generated by C<sysreader>.
The lambda when called, will read continually from C<$fh> into C<$buf>, and
will either fail on timeout, I/O error, or end of file, or succeed if C<$cond>
condition matches.

The condition C<$cond> is a "smart match" of sorts, and can be one of:

=over

=item integer

The lambda will succeed when exactly C<$cond> bytes are read from C<$fh>.

=item regexp

The lambda will succeed when C<$cond> matches the content of C<$buf>.
Note that C<readbuf> saves and restores value of C<pos($$buf)>, so use of
C<\G> is encouraged here.

=item coderef :: ($buf -> BOOL)

The lambda will succeed if coderef called with C<$buf> returns true value.

=item undef

The lambda will succeed on end of file. Note that for all other conditions end
of file is reported as an error, with literal C<"eof"> string.

=back

=item writebuf($writer) :: ($fh, $buf, $length, $offset, $deadline) -> ioresult

Creates a lambda that is able to perform buffered writes to C<$fh>, either
using custom lambda C<writer>, or using one newly generated by C<syswriter>.
That lambda, in turn, will write continually C<$buf> (from C<$offset>,
C<$length> bytes) and will either fail on timeout or I/O error, or succeed when
C<$length> bytes are written successfully.

=item getline($reader) :: ($fh, $buf, $deadline) -> ioresult

Same as C<readbuf>, but succeeds when a string of bytes ended by a newline
is read.

=back

=head2 Object API

This section lists methods of C<IO::Lambda> class. Note that by design all
lambda-style functionality is also available for object-style programming.
Together with the fact that lambda syntax is not exported by default, it thus
leaves a place for possible implementations of user-defined syntax, either
with or without lambdas, on top of the object API, without accessing the
internals.

The object API is mostly targeted to developers that need to connect
third-party asynchronous events with the lambda interface.

=over

=item new($class, $start)

Creates new C<IO::Lambda> object in the passive state. C<$start>
will be called once, after the lambda gets active.

=item watch_io($flags, $handle, $deadline, $callback)

Registers an IO event listener that will call C<$callback> either after
C<$handle> will satisfy condition of C<$flags> ( a combination of IO_READ,
IO_WRITE, and IO_EXCEPTION bits), or after C<$deadline> time is passed. If
C<$deadline> is undef, will watch for the file handle indefinitely.

The callback will be called with first parameter as integer set of IO_XXX
flags, or 0 if timed out. Other parameters, as with the other callbacks, will
be passed the result of the last called callback. The result of the callback
will be stored and passed on to the next callback.

=item watch_timer($deadline, $callback)

Registers a timer listener that will call C<$callback> after
C<$deadline> time.

=item watch_lambda($lambda, $callback)

Registers a listener that will call C<$callback> after C<$lambda>,
a C<IO::Lambda> object is finished. If C<$lambda> is in passive state,
it will be started first.

=item is_stopped

Reports whether lambda is stopped or not.

=item is_waiting

Reports whether lambda has any registered callbacks left or not.

=item is_passive

Reports if lambda wasn't run yet, -- either after C<new>
or C<reset>.

=item is_active

Reports if lambda was run.

=item reset

Cancels all watchers and switches the lambda to the passive state. 
If there are any lambdas that watch for this object, these will
be called first.

=item autorestart

If set, gives permission to watchers to reset the lambda if it 
becomes stopped. C<tail> does that when needed, other watchers
may too. Is set by default.

=item peek

At any given time, returns stored data that are either passed
in by C<call> if the lambda is in the passive state, or stored result
of execution of the latest callback.

=item start

Starts a passive lambda. Can be used for effective restart of the whole lambda;
the only requirement is that the lambda should have no pending events.

=item call @args

Stores C<@args> internally, to be passed on to the first callback. Only
works in passive state, croaks otherwise. If called multiple times,
arguments from the previous calls are overwritten.

=item terminate @args

Cancels all watchers and resets lambda to the stopped state.  If there are any
lambdas that watch for this object, these will be notified first. C<@args> will
be stored and available for later calls by C<peek>.

=item destroy

Cancels all watchers and resets lambda to the stopped state. Does the same to
all lambdas the caller lambda watches after, recursively. Useful where
explicit, long-lived lambdas shouldn't be subject to global destruction, which
kills objects in random order; C<destroy> kills them in some order, at least.

=item wait @args

Waits for the caller lambda to finish, returns the result of C<peek>.
If the object was in passive state, calls C<call(@args)>, otherwise
C<@args> are not used.

=item wait_for_all @lambdas

Waits for caller lambda and C<@lambdas> to finish. Returns
collection of C<peek> results for all objects. The results
are unordered.

=item wait_for_any @lambdas

Waits for at least one lambda from list of caller lambda and C<@lambdas> to
finish.  Returns list of finished objects.

=item yield $nonblocking = 0

Runs one round of dispatching events. Returns 1 if there are more events
in internal queues, 0 otherwise. If C<$NONBLOCKING> is set, exits as soon
as possible, otherwise waits for events; this feature can be used for
organizing event loops without C<wait/run> calls.

=item run

Enters the event loop and doesn't exit until there are no registered events.
Can be also called as package method.

=item bind @args

Creates an event record that contains the lambda and C<@args>, and returns it.
The lambda won't finish until this event is returned with C<resolve>.

C<bind> can be called several times on a single lambda; each event requires
individual C<resolve>.

=item resolve $event

Removes C<$event> from the internal waiting list. If lambda has no more
events to wait, notifies eventual lambdas that wait to the objects, and
then stops.

Note that C<resolve> doesn't provide any means to call associated
callbacks, which is intentional.

=item intercept $predicate [ $state = '*' ] $coderef

Installs a C<$coderef> as an overriding hook for a predicate callback, where
predicate is C<tail>, C<read>, C<write>, etc.  Whenever a predicate callback
is being called, the C<$coderef> hook will be called instead, that should be able to
analyze the call, and allow or deny it the further processing. 

C<$state>, if omitted, is equivalent to C<'*'>, that means that checks on
lambda state are omitted too. Setting C<$state> to C<undef> is allowed though,
and will match when the lambda state is also undefined (which it is by
default).

There can exist more than one C<intercept> handlers, stacked on top of each
other. If C<$coderef> is C<undef>, the last registered hook is removed.

Example:

    my $q = lambda { ... tail { ... }};
    $q-> intercept( tail => sub {
	if ( stars are aligned right) {
	    # pass
            return this-> super(@_);
	} else {
	    return 'not right';
	}
    });

See also C<state>, C<super>, and C<override>.

=item override $predicate [ $state = '*' ] $coderef

Installs a C<$coderef> as an overriding hook for a predicate - C<tail>, C<read>,
C<write>, etc, possibly with a named state.  Whenever a lambda calls one of
these predicates, the C<$coderef> hook will be called instead, that should be
able to analyze the call, and allow or deny it the further processing. 

C<$state>, if omitted, is equivalent to C<'*'>, that means that checks on lambda 
state are omitted too. Setting C<$state> to C<undef> is allowed though, and will
match when the lambda state is also undefined (which it is by default).

There can exist more than one C<override> handlers, stacked on top of each
other. If C<$coderef> is C<undef>, the last registered hook is removed.

Example:

    my $q = lambda { ... tail { ... }};
    $q-> override( tail => sub {
	if ( stars are aligned right) {
	    # pass
            this-> super;
	} else {
	    # deny and rewrite result
	    return tail { 'not right' }
	}
    });

See also C<state>, C<super>, and C<intercept>.

=item super

Analogous to Perl's C<SUPER>, but on the predicate level, this method is
designed to be called from overridden predicates to call the original predicate
or callback.

There is a slight difference in the call syntax, depending on whether it is
being called from inside an C<override> or C<intercept> callback. The
C<intercept>'ed callback will call the previous callback right away, and may
call it with parameters directly. The C<override> callback will only call the
predicate registration routine itself, not the callback, and therefore is
called without parameters. See L<intercept> and L<override> for examples of
use.

=item state $state

A helper function for explicit naming of predicate calls. The function stores
the C<$state> string on the current lambda; this string can be used in calls
to C<intercept> and C<override> to identify a particular predicate or a callback.

The recommended use of the method is when a lambda contains more than one
predicate of a certain type; for example the code

   tail {
   tail {
      ...
   }}

is therefore better to be written as

   state A => tail {
   state B => tail {
      ...
   }}
